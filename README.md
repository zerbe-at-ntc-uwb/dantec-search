# What is this?

This is the beginning of the GUI for DANTEc.

# What should I expect?

Not much.  It's essentially a generic data viewer linked to the datec-graphql
package.

# How do I make it work?

Good question.  I think `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` should get
something working.  It's in a fairly basic state currently; still working on
it, but it should display something if the above steps complete (and you have
the graphql dev server running).

# What about npm build.

Don't.  I don't think that really works presently and will flag a bunch of
errors.  Run in development mode only!

# There's an error...

Yup.  I am aware of errors being sent to the console.  I am trying to get
something set up to work.
